I need to try this one more time. Yes I do. So now I'm just gonna try this branche thing! Anyway I think the Git and GitHub and the Odin project and everything I am learning right now is SO  AWSOME! Thanks for your attention and be goodm bye
So I'm gonna repeat the same process, just to remember and not to forget directly. Also I have this issue - I downloaded the Linux Ubuntu but there seems to be no program like drawing or whatever and wtf I just need to make my profile pic a little smaller so I can upload it. Anyway... enough of this for today. Not enough studying though... it's never enough. Bye
